# Spot Light
- An online diary to keep your memories
## About the Project
- This project was created to solve the following issues when we share files with others:
	1. I wanted to keep entires and a calendar side by side.
	2. I needed a bookmark feature for my entries.

- I brought the following solutions to resolve the above concerns.
	1. I used a calendar library and kept all entry data on Firebase Database (Firestore) that observes realtime state changes.
